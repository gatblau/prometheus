# Usage:
#
# - include_role:
#     name: lib/manifest
#     tasks_from: add-deployment
#     vars:
#       deployment: <deployment string>
#
# Deployment string consists of the application name, version and a placeholder for the ports.
#   Note: spaces are required to maintain YAML indentation and newlines (\n) are also required.
# For example, for MySQL:
#  "    - app_name: MySQL\n        mysql_version: {{ hostvars['localhost']['mysql_version'] }}\n        mysql_ports:"
